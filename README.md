# Unsupervised_Learning

Task: Learn About the following topics in depth
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
- Decision Trees (Random Forest, Bagging Boosting)
- Clustering (K-Means & DB Scan)

Write a Report on the above topics, minimum 1 page for each topic, make sure you understand the material properly


Implement the below in CODE

  Implement K-Means clustering (Use of Libraries like Scikit-Learn is allowed)
  Use the same dataset used for logistic regression. Perform K-means clustering to cluster the data. Come up with the number of clusters using the elbow method. After fitting a model print out the centers and try to intuitively explain them. Try to visualize the clusters if possible.


All tasks to be done using Jupyter Notebook

BONUS TASK: Implement K-Means from scratch
